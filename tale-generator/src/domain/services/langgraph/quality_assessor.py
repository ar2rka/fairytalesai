Story Content:

Story Requirements:
- Target Age: {age_display}
- Moral: {moral}
- Language: {lang_name}
- Expected Length: {expected_word_count} words

Evaluation Criteria (score each 1-10):
1. Age Appropriateness (1-10): Does the language complexity, themes, and content match children aged {age_display} developmental level?
2. Moral Clarity (1-10): Is the moral lesson about "{moral}" clearly and naturally integrated into the story?
3. Narrative Coherence (1-10): Does the story have a clear beginning, middle, and end with logical flow?
4. Character Consistency (1-10): Do characters behave believably and consistently throughout?
5. Engagement (1-10): Is the story interesting and likely to maintain a child's attention?
6. Language Quality (1-10): Is the grammar correct, vocabulary appropriate, and style engaging?

Additional Considerations:
- Does the story length approximately match the expected word count?
- Are there any concerning elements (scary, violent, inappropriate)?
- Is the story original and creative?

Provide your assessment in the following JSON format:
{{
    "age_appropriateness_score": <1-10>,
    "moral_clarity_score": <1-10>,
    "narrative_coherence_score": <1-10>,
    "character_consistency_score": <1-10>,
    "engagement_score": <1-10>,
    "language_quality_score": <1-10>,
    "overall_score": <1-10>,
    "feedback": "Detailed explanation of scores and observations",
    "improvement_suggestions": ["suggestion1", "suggestion2", ...]
}}

IMPORTANT: Be critical but fair. A score of 7+ means high quality. Scores of 5-6 mean needs improvement. Below 5 means significant issues.
